## 🎯 The Problem

Traditional bookmarks are broken:
- 📁 Manual organization with folders and tags
- 🔍 Searching requires remembering exact keywords
- 😰 Finding that article you read last month? Good luck.

## ✨ The Solution

iMark uses AI to understand the **meaning** of every page you save:

```
You remember: "that article about how human memory works"
iMark finds: "The Science of Memory Formation and Recall"
```

No folders. No tags. Just save and search naturally.

## 🚀 Features

Right-click any webpage → "Save to iMark". That's it. No organizing required.
